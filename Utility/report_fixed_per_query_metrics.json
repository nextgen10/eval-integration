      "Bot": "A",
      "Response": "Based on the documentation, a RAG system consists of three main components: (1) Retrieval - which fetches relevant documents from a knowledge base using semantic search techniques, (2) Augmentation - which combines the retrieved context with the user's query, and (3) Generation - where a language model generates a response that is grounded in the retrieved information. This architecture ensures responses are factually accurate and traceable to source documents.",
      "Context": "RAG System Architecture: A Retrieval Augmented Generation system integrates three core components to produce accurate, grounded responses. The Retrieval component uses semantic search algorithms (often based on dense embeddings) to query a vector database and fetch the most relevant documents from a knowledge base. The Augmentation component prepares a prompt by combining the user's query with the retrieved context, ensuring the language model has access to relevant information. The Generation component employs a large language model (LLM) to synthesize the information and produce a coherent, contextually accurate response. This architecture significantly reduces hallucinations and improves factual accuracy by grounding responses in retrieved evidence.",

      "Bot": "A",
      "Response": "Photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy through two interconnected stages. First, in the light-dependent reactions occurring in the thylakoid membranes, chlorophyll molecules absorb light photons, which triggers the splitting of water molecules (photolysis), releasing oxygen and producing energy-rich molecules ATP and NADPH. Second, in the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle) taking place in the stroma, these ATP and NADPH molecules are utilized to convert atmospheric CO2 into glucose, a stable form of chemical energy that plants can store and metabolize.",
      "Context": "Photosynthesis: The Process of Energy Conversion: Photosynthesis is the fundamental process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose molecules. The process occurs in two main stages within chloroplasts. Stage 1: Light-Dependent Reactions (Light Reactions) take place in the thylakoid membranes. Chlorophyll and other pigments in photosystem II and I absorb photons of light energy. This energy drives the photolysis of water (H2O → 2H+ + 1/2O2 + 2e-), releasing oxygen as a byproduct. The absorbed energy is used to generate ATP through chemiosmosis and NADPH through electron transport chains. Stage 2: Light-Independent Reactions (Calvin Cycle) occur in the stroma of chloroplasts. Using the ATP and NADPH produced in the light reactions, the enzyme RuBisCO catalyzes the fixation of atmospheric CO2 into organic molecules. Through a series of reduction and regeneration steps, the Calvin cycle produces glucose (C6H12O6), a stable form of chemical energy that can be stored as starch or metabolized for cellular respiration.",

      "Query": "What are the key differences between REST and GraphQL APIs?",
      "Ground Truth": "REST APIs use multiple endpoints for different resources with standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), may lead to over-fetching or under-fetching data, and use HTTP caching naturally. GraphQL APIs use a single endpoint with a flexible query language, allow clients to request exactly the data they need in one request, provide strong typing through schemas, but require more complex caching strategies and have a steeper learning curve.",
      "Bot": "A",
      "Response": "REST and GraphQL APIs differ in several key aspects. REST APIs utilize multiple endpoints to represent different resources, employing standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. However, this can result in over-fetching or under-fetching data. REST benefits from straightforward HTTP caching mechanisms. In contrast, GraphQL APIs expose a single endpoint with a powerful query language that enables clients to request precisely the data they need in a single request, eliminating over-fetching. GraphQL provides strong typing through schemas and better developer experience, but requires more sophisticated caching strategies and has a steeper initial learning curve compared to REST.",
      "Context": "REST vs GraphQL: Architectural Comparison: REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that uses multiple resource-based endpoints (e.g., /users, /posts, /comments). Each endpoint supports standard HTTP methods (GET for retrieval, POST for creation, PUT/PATCH for updates, DELETE for removal). REST APIs often result in over-fetching (receiving more data than needed) or under-fetching (requiring multiple requests to gather all needed data). REST benefits from built-in HTTP caching using headers like ETag and Cache-Control. GraphQL, developed by Facebook, provides a single endpoint (typically /graphql) with a strongly-typed schema definition language. Clients can request exactly the fields they need using a query language, eliminating over-fetching. Multiple resources can be fetched in a single request, solving the under-fetching problem. GraphQL provides introspection capabilities for API exploration and excellent developer tooling. However, GraphQL requires more sophisticated caching strategies (often using Apollo Client or relay), and developers face a steeper learning curve compared to REST. GraphQL is ideal for complex, rapidly evolving APIs with diverse client needs, while REST remains simpler for straightforward CRUD operations.",
